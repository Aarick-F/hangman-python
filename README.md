# hangman-python
I've been doing a bit of side-learning in python lately.
I had some downtime at work, so I decided to put together
a quick command-line based hangman game similar to the one
I built a long time ago in javascript.

So far I'm really digging python and I'm excited to see how
I can take advantage of it in the near-future
